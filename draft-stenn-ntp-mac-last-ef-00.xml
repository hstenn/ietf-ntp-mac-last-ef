	chance that additional packet data could be either an Extension

      <t>Field Type: TBD (Recommendation for IANA: 0x1003 (MAC-EF, MAC INCLUDED), 0x3003 (MAC-EF, MAC OPTIONAL, MAC INCLUDED))</t>
      <t>Field Length: As needed.</t>
      <t>Payload: As described.</t>

      <t>A Field Type of 0 and a Length of 0 means this extension field is a
	crypto-NAK, as defined by RFC5905.  Otherwise, a Field Type value of
	TBD (0x1003 is suggested) identifies this extension field as a MAC
	Extension field.  The MAC Count is an unsigned 16-bit field, as is
	each MAC length field.  If there are an even number of MACs
	specified there is an unused 16-bit field which SHOULD be 0x0000 at
	the end of the set of MAC length values so that the subsequent MAC
	data is longword (4-octet) aligned.  Each MAC SHALL be padded so
	that any subsequent MAC starts on a 4-octet boundary.</t>

      <t>A MAC SHOULD NOT be present if there is a crypto-NAK present in the
	packet.</t>

      <t>Each MAC within the extension field consists of a 32-bit key
	identifier which SHOULD be unique to the set of key identifiers in
	this MAC extension field followed by ((MAC Length) - 4) octets of
	data, optionally followed by random octets to pad the key data to
	the length specified earlier in the extension field.  That key
	identifier is a shared secret which defines the algorithm to be used
	and a cookie or secret to be used in generating the digest.  The MAC
	digest is produced by hashing the data from the beginning of the NTP
	packet up to but not including the start of the MAC extension field.
	The calculation of the digest SHOULD be a hash of this data
	concatenated with the 32-bit keyid (in network-order), and the key.
	When sending or receiving a key identifier each side needs to agree
	on the key identifier, algorithm and the cookie or secret used to
	produce the digest along with the digest lengths.  Note that the
	sender may send more bytes than are required by the digest
	algorithm.  This would be done to make it more difficult for a
	casual observer to identify the algorithm being used based on the
	length of the data.  The digest data begins immediately after the
	key ID, and any padding octets SHOULD be random.</t>

      <t>Digests MD5, DES and SHA-1 are considered compromised and should

      <t>[DISCUSS] Each MAC length should be at least 20 octets long to
	allow for 4 octets of key ID and at least 16 octets of digest and
	random padding.  For a 128-bit digest, there would be 4 octets of
	key ID, 16 octets of digest, plus any desired octets of random
	padding.  For SHA-256 digests there are 4 octets of key ID, 32
	octets digest, plus any desired octets of random padding.  Using MAC
	lengths that include random padding may make it more difficult for
	an attacker to know which digest algorithms are used.</t>
